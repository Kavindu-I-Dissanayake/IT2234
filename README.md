-MathematicalEquation-
This JavaScript code is a simple mini-calculator. It demonstrates the difference between let and var when declaring variables, performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, and multiplication), and prints the results.

-PrintOddNumbers-
This JavaScript code uses for loops to print numbers in different ways. It first prints numbers from 1 to 10, then prints them in reverse from 10 to 1, and finally prints only the odd numbers between 1 and 10.

-PrintReverseNumberPattern-
This JavaScript code demonstrates the parseInt function and a reverse number pattern. It first shows how parseInt rounds down division results, then calculates half of 10 and prints numbers in reverse order around that value.
