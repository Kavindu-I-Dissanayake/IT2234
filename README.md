# Prime.js
## isPrime Function in JavaScript  

### Description  
- The function checks if a number is prime by counting its divisors.  
- A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has exactly two factors: 1 and itself.  
- The function iterates from 1 to the given number, counting how many times it is divisible.  
- If the count is exactly 2, the number is prime; otherwise, it is not.
